         <p align="center">  <b>Desktop-caliber gaming on the go</b>
Packed with incredible performance typically only available from desktops, 9th Gen Intel® Core™ laptop processors deliver desktop-caliber gaming that you can take anywhere. With up to 4.5GHz Turbo, 6 cores, and 12 threads, Legion laptops powered by these processors have enough power to handle demanding AAA games.
<br><b>NVIDIA® GeForce RTX™ 20 </b>Series graphics deliver the ultimate laptop gaming experience, with their Max-Q design enabling the world’s thinnest, fastest, and quietist gaming laptops.

       <b> Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 (2019) Tablet </b>
        </nav>
        <img src="images/article_tablet.jpg" alt="Paris" class="center">
        <p align="center">  In short, the Tab A 10.1 offers only minor upgrades over its three-year-old predecessor, but it is in keeping with a tablet that retails for 219 Euros (~$244). Samsung also sells an LTE variant, which costs an additional 50 Euros (~$56). By comparison, the Wi-Fi version of the Tab A 10.1 (2016) launched at 349 Euros (~$389); it is now much cheaper though.

We have chosen to compare the Tab A 10.1 against its predecessor along with other budget and midrange tablets. These will include the Amazon Fire HD 10, Apple iPad 6 2018, Huawei MediaPad M5 Lite and the Lenovo Tab M10. We shall also consider our review unit against the Galaxy Tab A 10.5 and the Galaxy Tab S5e.
The Tab A 10.1 supports Wi-Fi 5 connectivity and has a SAR body rating of 0.555 W/kg. By contrast, the LTE variant has a higher rating of 1.36 W/kg and utilises LTE Cat. 6 for up to 300 Mb/s download speeds along with 50 Mb/s upload speeds. The LTE model also supports eight LTE bands and can connect to 2G or 3G networks should you need to do so.
